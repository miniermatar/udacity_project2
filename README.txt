This project focuses on analyzing the European Soccer Database provided by Kaggle. The database has extensive information about more than 25,000 soccer matches in Europe from 2008 to 2016. I have extracted selected information using DB Browser for SQLite and stored it in a CSV file to be used within this notebook (I also included a short script to run the SQL query from this notebook). The section below briefly covers the SQL exploratory analysis carried out to decide which data will be used in this investigation.
The objective of this project is to develop some understanding on the probabilities for a team to win and to compare the observations with the betting odds from Bet365 (B365).
